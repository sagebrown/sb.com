The basic human need for exposure to nature and wide open spaces has long been documented, as has the positive effect of nature on the human psyche. In polar contrast, living in the city often creates a feeling of anxiety and confinement, overwhelmingly increased by never ending concrete and asphalt that make up urban sprawl, spewing traffic, new construction, and bright lights.

As an outlet and escape from that anxiety and chaos, my past work has focused on documenting stories surrounding place, people, and our relationship to the natural environment. With this series I continue to explore these desires and dreams of escape, but now closer to home,  I begin to confront our complex relationship with the hectic urban environment.

Weaving through a dreamlike narrative floating between worlds, this series explores the gentle tenderness that hangs in the balance between the urban environment and natural spaces that exist within. Grasping at something just beyond reach, a suggestive and fluid dynamic unfolds, just barely revealing itself between the layers of concrete. Moments of silence and tranquility are uncovered, but quickly whisked away by the gentle roar of the highway at rush hour. As these fleeting moments of natural refuge reveal themselves, the ever present desire for escape disappears for a brief blink of an eye.
